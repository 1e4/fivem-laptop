# FiveM Laptop

The idea of this mini project was to get Vue working with NUI,

## Install steps
Copy .env.example to .env
run `npm run build` within the UI directory
`start fivem-laptop` in game console
Type `/laptop` to open the laptop, password is '1234'

## Functionality
It talks to the backend server, if the password is correct then it will launch a basic laptop with no other functionality.
